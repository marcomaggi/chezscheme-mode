1. Introduction
---------------

This  package is  a distribution  of  Emacs Lisp  files implementing  an
editing mode  for Chez Scheme under  GNU Emacs.  Chez Scheme  is an R6RS
compliant Scheme implementation in the form of a native compiler.

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.

  The last  time the author  bothered to  update this paragraph,  he had
tested Chez Scheme version 9.4.1 and GNU Emacs 25.2.1.

3. Install
----------

Before  installing  Chez Scheme  Mode  make  sure  to have  a  correctly
installed Chez Scheme.

  To install  Chez Scheme Mode  from a  proper release tarball,  we must
unpack the archive then do:

   $ cd chezscheme-mode-0.1.0
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the  "DESTDIR" environment variable to install
the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/chezscheme-mode

  If, instead,  we have checked out  a revision from the  repository, we
will have  to first build the  infrastructure running a script  from the
top source directory:

   $ cd chez-mode
   $ sh autogen.sh

notice that "autogen.sh" will run the program "autoreconf".

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation generated from  the Texinfo sources.  The package
installs the documentation  in Info format; we can  generate and install
documentation in HTML format by running:

   $ make html
   $ make install-html


A. Credits
----------

Chez Scheme  Mode was  written by  Marco Maggi,  deriving code  from the
built-in Scheme mode.
